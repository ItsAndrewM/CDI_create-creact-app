# Do I need a new mainsail when upgrading to a mainsail reefing system?

## Introduction:

Sailing enthusiasts always strive to improve their sailing experience, and one way to achieve this is by upgrading their sail management system. If you're considering moving to a Mainsail Reefing System, you may be wondering, "Why do you need a new mainsail when moving to the Mainsail Reefing System?" In this article, we'll explore the reasons why upgrading to this system requires a new mainsail, and how it can enhance your sailing experience.

## What is a Mainsail Reefing System?

Before delving into the reasons for needing a new mainsail when moving to a Mainsail Reefing System, let's first understand what it is. A Mainsail Reefing System is a type of sail control mechanism that allows the mainsail to be reefed or furled. This innovative system enables sailors to adjust the sail area quickly and efficiently, all without leaving the cockpit. Making it easier and safer to manage your sail.

## Why do you need a new mainsail when moving to the Mainsail Reefing System?

Here are some reasons why:

1.  Size and shape: Mainsails designed for traditional mast and boom setups have a different size and shape than those designed for Mainsail Reefing Systems. A mainsail designed for a mainsail reefing system must have less roach, and must be flatter than a conventional main.
2.  Material: Mainsail Reefing Systems use a specific type of material that can withstand the stress and strain of reefing and furling. These materials are more durable than traditional mainsail materials, making them an essential part of the system.
3.  Design: The design of the mainsail is crucial to the system's efficiency and performance. Mainsails for reefing systems are designed to be easily reefed and unfurled, ensuring that the sail's shape and performance remain optimal.

## Benefits of the Mainsail Reefing System

Now that we've covered why you need a new mainsail when moving to the Mainsail Reefing System, let's explore the benefits of this innovative system:

1.  Easy handling: The Mainsail Reefing System allows sailors to adjust the sail area quickly and efficiently, making it easy to handle the sail and adjust to changing wind conditions without having to leave the cockpit.
2.  Enhanced safety: Reefing and furling the sail can be dangerous, especially in high winds. The Mainsail Reefing System makes this task more manageable and safer, reducing the risk of accidents.

## Considerations When Upgrading to a Mainsail Reefing System

If you're considering upgrading to a Mainsail Reefing System, here are some important considerations to keep in mind:

1.  Cost: Upgrading to a Mainsail Reefing System can be expensive, as it requires purchasing a new mainsail and the system itself. However, the benefits of the system can outweigh the initial investment.
2.  Maintenance: Unlike some mainsail reefing systems and furlers, the CDI MR2 and MR4/6 requires very little maintenance! We recommend rinsing the spool and bearing out with fresh water once or twice a season.
3.  Installation: Installing a Mainsail Reefing System can be done as a DIY project! We recommend having 1-2 people to help.
